# Gauge-Pointer-Reading
This project provides a robust solution for automatic reading of analog gauges using deep learning and geometric analysis. It supports circular instruments such as pressure gauges, water meters, and electric meters by detecting both the pointer and the scale lines, then calculating the pointer's relative position as a percentage.
